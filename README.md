### About Me 

- 🔭 My name is Betty: I'm currently completing my M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the University of Chicago
- 🌱 I'm learning (this quarter):
  - large-scale computing methods for the social sciences
  - program evaluation (RCTs, IVs, Panel Data, RDD)
  - data engineering platforms (GCP)
- 🕵️‍♀️ I’m looking to make an impact in the public sector: a role where I can dig into social inequities and sub-optimal services, and help design the solution.
- 💬 Ask me about my project on 311 potholes repair requests for the City of Boston last summer! 🕳️ 🚙

#### Background
My background is in k-12 education advocacy - prior to graduate school, I monitored the education outcomes of foster youth and incarcerated youth in LA County, focusing specifically on how school districts spent state funding and advocating for more academic support programs and social-emotional services for underserved student populations.

Since starting graduate school, I have undertaken a variety of individual and group projects as part of my coursework and as part of formal work experiences. Below is a summary of these projects.
